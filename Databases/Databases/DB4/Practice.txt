Find all pizzerias that serve only pizzas eaten by people over 30. 

1. find what pizzas are only eaten by those over 30.
(\project_{pizza}(\select_{age > 30}(Eats \join Person)))

((\project_{pizza}(Eats)) \diff (\project_{pizza}(\select_{age > 30}(Eats \join Person))))
3. Find all pizzarias that contain 2
(\project_{pizzeria}(Serves \join ((\project_{pizza}(Eats)) \diff (\project_{pizza}(\select_{age > 30}(Eats \join Person))))))
4. Take the complement of all pizzarias to obtain the answer.

Find all pizzerias that serve every pizza eaten by people over 30. 
1. find all pizzas eaten by people over 30.
(\project_{pizza}((\select_{age > 30}(Person)) \join (Eats)))
2. find all pizzerias that serve a pizza eaten by people over 30.
((\project_{pizza}((\select_{age > 30}(Person)) \join (Eats))) \join (Serves))
3. (slightly cheating knowing there are only two such pizzas) take the cross product of itself.
((\project_{pizza}((\select_{age > 30}(Person)) \join (Eats))) \join (Serves))

\cross
(\rename_{pizzab,pizzeriab,priceb}((\project_{pizza}((\select_{age > 30}(Person)) \join (Eats))) \join (Serves)))))
