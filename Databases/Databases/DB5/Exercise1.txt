Find the titles of all movies directed by Steven Spielberg. 
SELECT title
FROM Movie
WHERE director = 'Steven Spielberg'

Find all years that have a movie that received a rating of 4 or 5, and sort them in increasing order. 
SELECT DISTINCT year
FROM (Movie NATURAL JOIN Rating)
WHERE stars = 4 OR stars = 5
ORDER BY year ASC

Find the titles of all movies that have no ratings. 
SELECT title
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM Movie LEFT OUTER JOIN Rating ON Rating.mID = Movie.mID
    UNION
    SELECT * FROM Rating LEFT OUTER JOIN Movie ON Rating.mID = Movie.mID
)
WHERE stars IS NULL

Some reviewers didn't provide a date with their rating. Find the names of all reviewers who have ratings with a NULL value for the date. 
SELECT name
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM Reviewer LEFT OUTER JOIN Rating ON Rating.rID = Reviewer.rID
    UNION
    SELECT * FROM Rating LEFT OUTER JOIN Reviewer ON Rating.rID = Reviewer.rID
)
WHERE ratingDate IS NULL

Write a query to return the ratings data in a more readable format: reviewer name, movie title, stars, and ratingDate. 
Also, sort the data, first by reviewer name, then by movie title, and lastly by number of stars. 
SELECT name,title,stars,ratingDate
FROM (
	(Rating NATURAL JOIN Movie) NATURAL JOIN Reviewer
)
ORDER BY name,title,stars

For all cases where the same reviewer rated the same movie twice and gave it a higher rating the second time, 
return the reviewer's name and the title of the movie. 
SELECT DISTINCT T1.name,T1.title
FROM (
	(Rating NATURAL JOIN Movie NATURAL JOIN Reviewer) AS T1 
    CROSS JOIN 
    (Rating NATURAL JOIN Movie NATURAL JOIN Reviewer) AS T2
)
WHERE ((T1.stars < T2.stars AND T1.ratingDate < T2.ratingDate) OR (T1.stars > T2.stars AND T1.ratingDate > T2.ratingDate)) AND T1.name = T2.name AND T1.title = T2. title

For each movie that has at least one rating, find the highest number of stars that movie received. 
Return the movie title and number of stars. Sort by movie title. 
SELECT DISTINCT title AS t2,stars
FROM Movie NATURAL JOIN Rating
WHERE stars IN (
    SELECT MAX(stars)
    FROM Movie NATURAL JOIN Rating
    WHERE t2 = title
)
ORDER BY title ASC

For each movie, return the title and the 'rating spread', that is, 
the difference between highest and lowest ratings given to that movie. 
Sort by rating spread from highest to lowest, then by movie title. 
SELECT title1, (starsMax - starsMin) AS ratingSpread
FROM (
	SELECT DISTINCT title AS title1,stars AS starsMax
	FROM Movie NATURAL JOIN Rating
	WHERE stars IN (
		SELECT MAX(stars)
		FROM Movie NATURAL JOIN Rating
		WHERE title1 = title
	)),
	(
	SELECT DISTINCT title AS title2,stars AS starsMin
	FROM Movie NATURAL JOIN Rating
	WHERE stars IN (
		SELECT MIN(stars)
		FROM Movie NATURAL JOIN Rating
		WHERE title2 = title
	))
WHERE title1 = title2
ORDER BY ratingSpread DESC,title1 ASC

Find the difference between the average rating of movies released before 1980 and the average rating of movies released after 1980. 
(Make sure to calculate the average rating for each movie, then the average of those averages for movies before 1980 and movies after. 
Don't just calculate the overall average rating before and after 1980.) 
SELECT before-after
FROM (
    SELECT AVG(subAverages) AS before
    FROM (
        SELECT AVG(stars) as subAverages
        FROM Movie NATURAL JOIN Rating
        WHERE year < 1980
        GROUP BY title
    )
),(
	SELECT AVG(subAverages) AS after
	FROM (
		SELECT AVG(stars) as subAverages
		FROM Movie NATURAL JOIN Rating
		WHERE year > 1980
		GROUP BY title
	)
)
