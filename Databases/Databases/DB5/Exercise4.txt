It's time for the seniors to graduate. Remove all 12th graders from Highschooler. 
DELETE FROM Highschooler
WHERE grade = 12

If two students A and B are friends, and A likes B but not vice-versa, remove the Likes tuple.
DELETE FROM Likes
WHERE EXISTS(
    SELECT 1 FROM Friend 
    WHERE Likes.ID1 = Friend.ID1 
    AND Likes.ID2 = Friend.ID2 
    AND NOT EXISTS(
        SELECT 1 FROM Likes AS S2
        WHERE S2.ID1 = Friend.ID2
        AND   S2.ID2 = Friend.ID1
    )
)

For all cases where A is friends with B, and B is friends with C, add a new friendship for the pair A and C. 
Do not add duplicate friendships, friendships that already exist, or friendships with oneself. 
INSERT INTO Friend
SELECT DISTINCT ID1out,ID2out
FROM(
    (SELECT ID1 AS ID1out, ID2 AS IDf FROM Friend) 
    NATURAL JOIN 
    (SELECT ID1 AS IDf, ID2 AS ID2out FROM Friend)
) WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Friend
    WHERE ID1 = ID1out AND ID2 = ID2out
) AND ID1out <> ID2out
