CSCI 191T: Game Development
Project Proposal
"Hail of Fire"

Short Description: This game will be a side scrolling, shoot 'em up game using procedural background generation. 

Detailed Description:  
The player's objective is to move a fighter jet around the screen and fire at oncoming enemy fighters, in addition to tank and battleship fire. 
The range of flight will be limited by the area within their screen with a bird's eye view of their surroundings. 
The player must also avoid buildings and other oncoming fighter planes to avoid being destroyed. 
The fighter jet's health points will be a shield that has the ability to recover from damage over a period of time. 
If the player’s fighter jet is destroyed from enemy fire or multiple collisions, then the game will be restarted from the beginning of the level. 
At the end of the level, the player must engage in a boss battle to win the game. 
We’ll be using C++ and SFML library to develop the game. 
We’ll also be exploring in procedural background generation to spawn random backgrounds, enemies, and obstacles within the player's surroundings.
