	Step 2 Cookies and State
	https://github.com/SSBMFreak/WebDev/blob/master/Exercises2/uuid.go


Instructions-
	Handle the CSS folder
	Have two page handlers
		"/"
			This page executes a template "index.html" with a nil object
			After executing the template if a cookie session-info exists it will print the uuid after executing the template
				fmt.Fprintf(res,cookie.uuid)
		"/login/"
			This page will check if a cookie session-info exists
			If so it will do nothing.
			Otherwise it will make the cookie session-info.
			Despite the name we wont be executing "login.html"
			
			Regardless of what it does, it will redirect to "/"
			afterwards.
