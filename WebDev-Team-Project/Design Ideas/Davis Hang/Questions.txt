CSCI 130 Web Development - Team Group Project - Phase 1 Questions and Answers (Proposed, not final until everyone is ok with it)

1.	What is flex box?
It's a new layout mode in CSS3, use when page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.
In our project, we applied the flex-box format to every object above-the-fold and below-the-fold. Ex: the nav bar, the contents, the footer.

2.	How is a flex container declared?
A flex container is declared by setting the 'display' property of an element to either 'flex' (rendered as a block) or 'inline-flex' (rendered as inline).

3.	What is a media query?
Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.
It uses the '@media' rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.
The @media rule is used to define different style rules for different media types/devices.
Media queries look at the capability of the device, and can be used to check many things, such as:
    width and height of the viewport
    width and height of the device
    orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
    resolution
    and much more

4.	How did you apply the media query to your project?
We use a media query on our project to add a breakpoint at 400px.  If the screen width is less than 400px, the sidebars and footer image are hidden.

5.	What is SVG, and where is inline SVG applied?
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.  It is an image format for vector graphics, basically it is used to define graphics for the Web.

We used it on our 'Top Button' image; inside the anchor <a> tag with the id name 'to-the-top' in the index.html file and '#to-the-top' in our style.css file.  The SVG specify it's shape, size, and the text that's inside of it.

6.	How does the drop down navigation bar work?
Works with CSS Selectors:
 .dropDown:hover, .dropDownItems ,.dropDown:focus, .dropDownItems{
	/*Display the block*/
	display:block;
	/*Set the block's width to the width of its parent.*/
	width:100%;
}
The hover selector activates the css when the mouse hovers over an item(in this case drop down)
The focus selector is for tapping on mobile.

7.	Why doesnâ€™t the navigation drop down element show normally?
.dropDownItems{
	/*Don't show the drop down list initially.*/
	display: none;
	/*Attatch it to dropdown*/
	position: absolute;
	/*Set background to maroon.*/
	background-color: #4C0A38;
}

Initially dropDownItems has a display: none; which will prevent it from being shown until the css selector is activated

8.	What parts of the web page are above the fold?
The navigation bar(including the nav drop-down menu), the "TOP" button, anything in the #atf container, and the background.
