(4/20/2016)  Hello there! This is Jacob Rachal with a couple of project ideas and such.  So let's get started!
NOTE: IF YOU AREN'T JACOB RACHAL, THEN DON'T BLOODY CHANGE THIS FILE!!
            Thank You.

- Have multiple page styles for whatever website we decide to make, and allow the user(after logging in)
    to switch their page style, but only from their perspective (aka on their machine).
        Purpose: simply changing the asthetics of the website from the user's perspective. Keeps things fresh.

- Have things set up to allow the makers of the website to upload new page styles,
    and when a user logs in post-upload or refreshes a page, there is a notice about a new style (or styles)
    that is availible for use.

- Starter Style Ideas:
    - some sort of a generic starter/introduction-for-new-users pages style.
    - "WW2 USN DC iz OP" Have the background loop through images of the Navy ships with famous stories about
       how when their bow/other-part got shot off, they were able to limp back to safety due to their
       Damage Control teams. Perhaps also include a short blurb about each ship?
    - "FluffyHappyKitties" Has a background that iterates thrugh images of kittens.
       Also makes the fonts/buttons/etc. very kid-like and 'happy'.
    - Steampunk
    - Mountains
    - Forrest
    - Space
    - River


(4/21/2016) DESIGN
- team name:: CRWH ("crew"), because RWBY team-naming-schemes is different and interesting!
-GENERAL
    - when in mobile form, have a font-resizer drop-down menu show up amongst the top of the screen.
    - have things that are not there/hidden on the mobile version that would otherwise be there on desktop screen.
        - For example, instead of having the full bios in the footer, have the CRWH placed vertically with
           team member names placed by their last name initial.
          EX:
             Cazarez, Arlene
             Rachal, Jacob
             Willeford, Kenneth
             Hang, Davis
    - have the main bar remain in place at the top of the browser window when scrolling, for all screen sizes.
    - Designate a above-the-fold background/picture and a below-the-fold background?

 - Below the fold
    - have the team members be in the bottom section of the page, amongst all the copyright and source information.
    - just have a bunch of lorem ispum text below the fold in dated text boxes?

(4/25/16) MORE THINGS
- In nav menu, have an About Us/Mission Statement page. A contact Us/Report A Bug button?
- the people that are users and log in can participate in discussions and debates on the website topic.
- Allow users to rate posts as Informative, Funny, Like+1, Facepalm, Heartwarming, WTF, tl;dr, and so on.
-- NEED to attach the TOP button to the below the fold.

Questions to be asked:
Something about flexbox (what elements were used to create it)? need more
- Flexbox was used for the general orientation of elements. Applied to the nav bar as well as the main content below the fold.

what did we use media queries for? What does it do? How did it affect the page?
- We querried the screens width and if it goes below 400 pixels, it removes the left & right columns of the main content as well as the footer image.

What parts of the web page are above-the-fold?
- the navigation bar(including the nav drop-down menu), the "TOP" button, and anything in the #atf container. And the background.

What is the svg object? Does it work?
- It is the "TOP" button, a 100X100 svg container, then we made a circle with a maroon fill and a thick stroke, and then we made a svg-text object with the text "TOP".
  Yes.

PLANS FOR THE FUTURE (5-2-16)
Since I didn't manage to get anything done for this project over the weekend, haves some crazy ideas of what we can make for the website.
  I am thinking of a wierd mashup of Twitter, MOCpages, and a forum, where the purpose of the site is to find and share crazy-awesome-badass things.
    (Things being defined as tales from history, recent events, inventions, amazing videos, must-read fiction, what-have-you.)
  Some things that the first users (us) and mods could link to could be:
   - the Badass Of The Week site (Trope- What It Says On the Lid) (short description here) (url here)
   - The Ballard of Edgardo (short description here)(url here)
   - the incredible WH40K Quest "Embers in the Dawn" (short description here)(url here)
   - RWBY Red Trailer (short description)(url here)
   - "Sand Won't save you This Time" blog post (url here)
   - Incredible quotes (miscelaneous)
   - get other things from teammates
   - Top Gear videos: Ariel Atom, Mobile Cottage, others,
   -- store the uuid also in the URL (?) so that if a user has cookies disabled, they can still yse the website. Kenneth thinks this is a poor idea since we may as well just use the URL instead of cookies.
   - colinfuze's(?) channel.
   - a spoiler feature to hide whatever it is the user is sharing in case it is quite spoilery for a series.
   - Allow other users to comment on a post someone made.
