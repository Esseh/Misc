1. How Does the Drop Down Navigation Work?
	css selectors

.dropDown:hover .dropDownItems ,.dropDown:focus .dropDownItems{
	/*Display the block*/
	display:block;
	/*Set the block's width to the width of its parent.*/
	width:100%;
}

The hover selector activates the css when the mouse hovers over 
an item(in this case drop down)
The focus selector is for tapping on mobile.




2. Why doesn't the drop down element show normally?
.dropDownItems{
	/*Don't show the drop down list initially.*/
	display: none;
	/*Attatch it to dropdown*/
	position: absolute;
	/*Set background to maroon.*/
	background-color: #4C0A38;
}

Initially dropDownItems has a display: none;
which will prevent it from being shown until the css selector is activated
